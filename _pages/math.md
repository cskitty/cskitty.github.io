### About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)  is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.  

Project Euler in Python provides solutions to Project Euler problems using Python programs. [Notebook](https://github.com/cskitty/cskitty.github.io/blob/master/notebook/projecteuler.ipynb)
