project starcoder was founded in 2019 by cskitty. The site was created to host a variety of programming and programming-adjacent topics, presented in video and text forms. 

Online articles are written by cskitty and [cryptobunny](https://starcoder.org/aboutcryptobunny/). While writing projects for Python tutorials, Cryptobunny also creates solutions for [Project Euler](/tags/math/). In the meantime,  she also writes articles for [cryptography](/tags/cryptography/).


In 2020, we started offering [tutorials and live classes](/tutorials/) to K-12 students throughout the USA and Canada.
