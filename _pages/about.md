Project Starcoder was started in 2019 by Cskitty and [Cryptobunny](https://starcoder.org/aboutcryptobunny/). The site [starcoder.org](https://starcoder.org) is created to host coding tutorial videos and articles.

In the year 2020, Cskitty started offering [tutorials and live classes](/tutorials/) to K-12 students throughout USA and Canada.  

While writing projects for Python tutorials, Cryptobunny also creates solutions for [Project Euler](/tags/math/). In the meantime,  she also writes articles for [cryptography](/tags/cryptography/).
