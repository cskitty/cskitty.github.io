## Python for Beginner Lesson 3: Turtle

 In this tutorial we will learn how to draw a graph using Python Turtle library.

 “Turtle” is a python feature like a drawing board, which lets you command a turtle to draw all over it!
You can use functions like turtle.forward(...) and turtle.left(...) which can move the turtle around.

As a starting point, you can draw a line using python turtle functions: there are four steps involved:

1. Import the turtle module
2. Create a turtle to control and assign a name to it
3. Draw things.   
   1. Draw more things with forward(...) or backward(...)
   2. Draw more things.   
4. Run turtle.done() after finishing.
