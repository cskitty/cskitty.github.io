## Problem 1. Angry Cows

[Angry Cows](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=594)

Bessie the cow has designed what she thinks will be the next big hit video game: "Angry Cows". The premise, which she believes is completely original, is that the player shoots cows with a slingshot into a one-dimensional scene consisting of a set of hay bales located at various points on a number line. Each cow lands with sufficient force to detonate the hay bales in close proximity to her landing site. The goal is to use a set of cows to detonate all the hay bales.  

There are N hay bales located at distinct integer positions $$x_1,x_2,…,x_N$$ on the number line. If a cow is launched with power R landing at position x, this will causes a blast of "radius R", destroying all hay bales within the range $$x−R…x+R$$.  

A total of K cows are available to shoot, each with the same power R. Please determine the minimum integer value of R such that it is possible to use the K cows to detonate every single hay bale in the scene.  

INPUT FORMAT (file angry.in):  

The first line of input contains N ($$1\leN\le50,000$$) and K ($$1\leK\le10$$). The remaining N lines all contain integers $$x_1…x_N$$ (each in the range $$0…1,000,000,000$$).

OUTPUT FORMAT (file angry.out):  
Please output the minimum power $$R$$ with which each cow must be launched in order to detonate all the hay bales.

## Problem 2. Subsequences Summing to Sevens

Farmer John's N cows are standing in a row, as they have a tendency to do from time to time. Each cow is labeled with a distinct integer ID number so FJ can tell them apart. FJ would like to take a photo of a contiguous group of cows but, due to a traumatic childhood incident involving the numbers 1…6, he only wants to take a picture of a group of cows if their IDs add up to a multiple of 7.
Please help FJ determine the size of the largest group he can photograph.  

INPUT FORMAT (file div7.in):  
The first line of input contains N ($$1\leN\le50,000$$). The next N lines each contain the N integer IDs of the cows (all are in the range $$0…1,000,000$$).  
OUTPUT FORMAT (file div7.out):  
Please output the number of cows in the largest consecutive group whose IDs sum to a multiple of $$7$$. If no such group exists, output $$0$$.  
You may want to note that the sum of the IDs of a large group of cows might be too large to fit into a standard 32-bit integer. If you are summing up large groups of IDs, you may therefore want to use a larger integer data type, like a 64-bit "long long" in C/C++.

In this example, $$5+1+6+2+14 = 28$$.  

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
int main() {
    ifstream cin ("div7.in");
    ofstream cout ("div7.out");

    ll N;
    cin >> N;

    vector<ll> cows(N);
    vector<ll> prefix(N + 1);

    F0R(i, N) {
        cin >> cows[i];
        prefix[i + 1] = ( prefix[i] + cows[i]) % 7;
    }

    vector<int> myVec(7);
    F0R(i, 7) {
        myVec[i] = -1;
    }
    int maximum = 0;

    F0R(i, prefix.size()) {
        if (myVec[prefix[i]] == -1) {
            myVec[prefix[i]] = i;
        }
        else {
            maximum = max(i - myVec[prefix[i]], maximum);
        }
    }
    cout << maximum;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Problem 3. Build Gates

Farmer John decides to build a new fence around parts of his farm, but he keeps getting distracted and ends up building the fence into a much stranger shape than he intended!  

Specifically, FJ starts at position (0,0) and takes N steps, each moving one unit of distance north, south, east, or west. Each step he takes, he lays a unit of fence behind him. For example, if his first step is to the north, he adds a segment of fence from (0,0) to (0,1). FJ might re-visit points multiple times and he may even lay the same segment of fence multiple times. His fence might even cross over itself if his path cuts through a run of fencing he has already built.  

Needless to say, FJ is rather dismayed at the result after he completes the fence. In particular, he notices that it may be the case that he has now partitioned off some areas of the farm from others, so that one can no longer walk from one region to another without crossing a fence. FJ would like to add gates to his fences to fix this problem. A gate can be added to any unit-length segment of fence he has built, allowing passage between the two sides of this segment.  

Please determine the minimum number of gates FJ needs to build so that every region of the farm is once again reachable from every other region.  

INPUT FORMAT (file gates.in):  
The first line of input contains N (1≤N≤1000). The next line contains a string of length N describing FJ's path. Each character is either N (north), E (east), S (south), or W (west).  
OUTPUT FORMAT (file gates.out):  
Write out a single integer giving the minimum number of gates FJ needs to build to restore complete connectivity to all regions of his farm. Note that the answer could be zero if the farm is connected to begin with.
