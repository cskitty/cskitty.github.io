# USACO 2020 Feb Silver

## Problem 1. Swapity Swapity Swap

Farmer John's N cows (1≤N≤105) are standing in a line. The ith cow from the left has label i for each 1≤i≤N.  
Farmer John has come up with a new morning exercise routine for the cows. He has given the cows M pairs of integers (L1,R1)…(LM,RM), where 1≤M≤100. He then tells the cows to repeat the following M-step process exactly K (1≤K≤109) times:   

For each i from 1 to M:  
The sequence of cows currently in positions Li…Ri from the left reverse their order.
After the cows have repeated this process exactly K times, please output the label of the ith cow from the left for each 1≤i≤N.  

SCORING:  
Test case 2 satisfies N=K=100.  
Test cases 3-5 satisfy K≤103.  
Test cases 6-10 satisfy no additional constraints.  
INPUT FORMAT (file swap.in):  
The first line contains N, M, and K. For each 1≤i≤M, line i+1 line contains Li and Ri, both integers in the range 1…N, where Li<Ri.  
OUTPUT FORMAT (file swap.out):  
On the ith line of output, print the ith element of the array after the instruction string has been executed K times.  
SAMPLE INPUT:  
```
7 2 2
2 5
3 7
```
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
```
1
2
4
3
5
7
6
```
Initially, the order of the cows is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] from left to right. After the first step of the process, the order is [1,5,4,3,2,6,7]. After the second step of the process, the order is [1,5,7,6,2,3,4]. Repeating both steps a second time yields the output of the sample.
