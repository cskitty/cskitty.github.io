## Modeling a cannon using Python


Let us model a cannon using Python: given the same initial speed, how to hit a target in a given position with a cannon?
Let the cannon be placed in the origin, i.e. its initial coordinate is (0,0) and the rest of parameters are:

$$\begin{cases}
x_0 = 0  meters\\
y_0 = 0  meters\\
t   = 30 seconds \\
v_0 = 10  m/s \\
g  = -10  m/s^2 \\
\theta = 30,45,60
\end{cases}
$$

Suppose a cannon can fire a bullet with the initial velocity $$v_{0}$$ from the horizon.
What is the best shooting angle $$\theta$$ that will fire the cannon bullet furthest ?
As the bullet's motion is determined by initial speed, angle and gravity.
The two dimensional kinematic formula gives us all equations needed:


$$\begin{cases}
v_{x0} = v_0  \cos\theta \\
v_{y0} = v_0  \sin\theta \\
x_1 =x_0 + v_{x0}  t \\
y_1 =y_0 + v_{y0}   t + \frac{1}{2}gt ^2
\end{cases}
$$

Copy the code below, open the [Python Playground](http://starcoder.org/playground/), paste the code and run it.
