# Python Tutorial - Lesson 1: Variables and Print

## Numbers
Numbers in Python work like what you've learned from your math class including but not limit to counting numbers, negative numbers, decimals so on and so force.

To show you what I mean, type a few more numbers into the console below, pressing return after each one. You can also use operators.
For example, try type
$$11*11$$ below.

## Basic Data Types

### Integer

While in other languages (C, java), there's limitation on the size of Integers. In Python, there is no limit to how long an integer value can be. It is only constrained by the amount of memory your system has. 111, 222, -232301231231 are examples of integers in Python.

### String

Strings are sequences of character data. The string type in Python is called str.
String literals may be delimited using either single or double quotes. All the characters between the opening delimiter and matching closing delimiter are part of the string: "hello word" or 'hello world'.

### Float (decimals)

The float type in Python designates a decimal number. float values are specified with a decimal point. Scientific notation is can be used here.
0.123, 1.1e3,  3.14159 are all valid float numbers.


### Boolean

Boolean value in Python may have one of two values, True or False.

## The print() function

Type print("Hello World") in the above console and see what happens.
