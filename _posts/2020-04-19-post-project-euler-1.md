# Project Euler in Python Series 1

## Problem 1 Multiples of 3 and 5


If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


```python
def problem_1():
    sum = 0
    for x in range(1000):
        if x % 15 == 0:
            sum += x
        elif x % 5 == 0:
            sum += x
        elif x % 3 == 0:
            sum += x
    return sum
print(problem_1())
```


## Problem 2 Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


```python
def problem_2():
    fibonacci = [1, 1]
    while fibonacci[-1] <= 4000000:
        fibonacci.append(fibonacci[-1] + fibonacci[-2])
    sum = 0
    for x in fibonacci:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            sum += x
    return sum
print(problem_2())
```
