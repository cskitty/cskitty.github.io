# Project Euler in Python Series 1

## Problem 1 Multiples of 3 and 5


If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


```python
def problem_1():
    sum = 0
    for x in range(1000):
        if x % 15 == 0:
            sum += x
        elif x % 5 == 0:
            sum += x
        elif x % 3 == 0:
            sum += x
    return sum
print(problem_1())
```


## Problem 2 Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


```python
def problem_2():
    fibonacci = [1, 1]
    while fibonacci[-1] <= 4000000:
        fibonacci.append(fibonacci[-1] + fibonacci[-2])
    sum = 0
    for x in fibonacci:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            sum += x
    return sum
print(problem_2())
```

## Problem 3 Largest prime factor
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

```python
def smallest_prime_factor(x):
    for y in range(2, x):
        if x % y == 0:
            return y
    return x

def problem_3():
    num = 600851475143
    while num != smallest_prime_factor(num):
        f = smallest_prime_factor(num)
        if f <= num:
            num //= f
        else:
            break
    return num

print(problem_3())
```

## Problem 4 Largest palindrome product
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

```python
def problem_4():
    list = []
    for x in range(999, 100, -1):
        for y in range(999, 100, -1):
            l = str(x*y)
            reversed = [l[i] for i in range(len(l) - 1, -1, -1)]
            if str(x * y) == "".join(reversed):
                 list.append(x * y)
    return max(list)
print(problem_4())
```
